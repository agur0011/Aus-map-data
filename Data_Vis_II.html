    <p>Please interact with the legend to select a duration for years of stay. This way it is obvious which to compare which states have more residents in shorter term or longer term living situations.

    <!-- Description for the piechart -->
    <p>The legend for this pie chart can also be interacted with. Satisfaction with where an individual lives is quite an important metric. 
      Considering a choice to live between each dwelling type, the highest satisfaction is with Semi-detached/row or terrace house/townhouses at 41.3%.<p> 
    <p>When deciding on a property type to purchase or rent this high satisfaction level can be representative of housing types which are less susceptible to damage which causes inconvenience.<p>

    <p>The legend for tenure type can be interacted with. Once selected it will show a comparison of the percentages on the bottom graph for the selected tenure type for easier comparison. 
      When viewing this graph there is some incomplete data which is why the values do not add to 100%.<p>
    <p>From this combination of graphs it is obvious that 12 month rental agreements are the most common, especially in Tasmania representing 61.8% of the collected rental agreement types. 
    Short term rentals (6 months) appear to be most common in the Northern Territory (18.5%) and Queensland (16.5%).<p> 
    <p>This could inform decision making looking for shorter term rentals for positions which may be contracted and require you to only be in the state for a shorter period of time.<p>
